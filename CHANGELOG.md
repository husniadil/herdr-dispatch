# Changelog

What a consumer of `hdis` has to change between released versions. §13.3 of
the shared plugin contract makes the CLI, the MCP tool list, the JSON shapes
and the error codes stable within a minor and changeable between minors with an
entry here, so every entry says what moved and what a caller does about it.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-21

First release. One binary, `hdis`, that is the daemon, the CLI and the stdio
MCP server. It watches the `htask` board, brings a worker pane up in Herdr for
each ready task, delivers the task's goal, tracks the worker, and stops at
review, where the board's own review gate takes over. Declares the shared
plugin contract at 0.4.0.
